The locals use the name of Athugalpuraya to identify the town.
The rock has derived its name as the rock is in the shape of an elephant and is 325 meters tall. There is a myth of the local in the vicinity that the rock has obtained such formation due to animals turning into rocks not being able to withstand the severe drought.
There is a temple on the top of the rock and also, a big Samadhi Buddha statue overlooking the city of Kurunegala though there is a temple on the top of the cliff, individuals from many faiths visiting the temple to enjoy the hike and the adventurous journey towards the top of the mountain.
One could use the stairs to reach the top of the mountain or could use the vehicle to climb up. Hiking your journey to the top of the mountain is more rewarding than using the car to reach the top. Hiking towards the top of the hill is preferred by many young and old individuals.
The best time to start hiking up the rock is during or after the sunset, as it would give a panoramic view of the Kurunegala city, with the sun setting off coloring the sky in the shades of pink and purple, the busy lights of the vehicles begin to appear followed by the bright lights from the shops and other parts gives a breathtaking view.

			<h3>Ethkanda Raja Maha Viharaya</h3>
It was believed that this temple was built in the Dambadeniya era during the 14 - 15 centuries, it has played an important role in translating the Pali Jataka tales book to Sinhalese under the reign of the Dambadeniya king Parakramabahu IV. There are amazing paintings and Buddha statues within the image house, and the Bodhi tree was believed to be from the Anuradhapura Era.

Parakramabahu IV of Dambadeniya was known as a great scholar and was called Pandit Parakramabahu. He made some significant contributions to Sinhalese literature and was responsible for writing the Dhalada Siritha. One of the main publications was the translation of the Pali Jataka tales to Sinhala. It was said that the main Buddhist monk who led the translation of Jataka tales was residing in Athkanda Raja Maha Viharaya.
The temple was built by Buvanekabahu III, brother of Parakramabahu IV. According to Asgiri Thalpatha when Parakramabahu IV built the Kandy Asgiriya temple it was offered to the monks of Athkanda Viharaya and they were invited to reside in Kandy.
