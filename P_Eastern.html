            <p><h3>Saama Chaithya (Peace Pagoda)</h3>
Ampara Peace Pagoda is one of a number of Peace Pagodas in the world, built since World War II and designed to promote the non-violence in the community and unite them in their search for world peace. It is located in Ampara, a small town located in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka and is one of the Ampara's most prominent landmarks. There are another four Peace Pagodas constructed in various places around Sri Lanka. They are located at Unawatuna, Adam's Peak, Bandarawela and Walapane

			<h3>Buddhangala Raja Maha Viharaya</h3>
This area belonged to the Digamadulla Kingdom which was started by Prince Dighayu in the 4th century BC. All though the beginning of this monastery is not documented, Ven Ellawala Medhananda Thero states that the history of is monastery is as old as the Digamadulla Kingdom
Lost in the history, covered by thick jungle infested with wild animals, exposed to the elements for over thousands of years, this monastery was brought back to life in 1964 by a young brave bikku called Kalutara Dhammananda, (incumbent high priest today) who traveled through the thick jungles and cleared the area with the assistance of Buddhists in the area.
This hermitage came to prominence due the relics unearthed during excavation of the original stupa. Among them was a 4 inch gold casket with 3 golden lotus flowers standing on its stems with carefully placed relics on each of them. The centre flower was tallest and two bo leaves on the other two stems had the names “Sariputha” and “Maha Moggalana” inscribed on them. How these relics of the two chief decipals of Buddha came to Sri Lanka is not known, but it is believed this would have been given by a private donor who probably had them in custody for some time. The relic casket shows characteristics of 5th century work but the inscriptions on the golden bo leaves are said to be belonging to Pre – Christian Era.

			<p><h3>Samangala Aranya Senasanaya</h3>
Samangala Aranya Senasanaya or Samangala Forest Hermitage is an ancient Cave temple in Ampara, Sri Lanka. The temple is located west from the Kohombana junction of Ampara - Mahaoya main road, approximately 23 km away from the Ampara town. The monastery has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological site in Sri Lanka. It is believed that this temple complex was constructed by the king Saddha Tissa of Anuradhapura. During the recent history the site had been neglected due to the activities of Tamil Taiger separatist in the region. With the end of the civil war, the Hermitage was again accessible to the people. A large number of drip ledged caves with Pre Christian Brahmi cave inscriptions have been found on the slope of the eastern side of the Samangala mountain. An inscribed sketch in one cave illustrates a Stupa similar to the style of Sanchi Stupa in India

				<h3>Pasikuda Beach</h3>
Pasikuda is the pin up of picture postcard beaches thanks to its soft white sand and translucent water. Between May and September, this is the best place in Sri Lanka for a Sri Lankan beach holiday. Most days are cloudless, the ocean is warm, and water clarity is very good which makes it ideal for snorkelling, diving, sailing and a host of other water sports. The curve of Pasikuda bay means that swimming can be enjoyed throughout the year.
Pasikuda is a relatively new destination in Sri Lanka for luxury beach holidays and the resorts lining Pasikuda, such as Uga Bay, all benefit from generous manicured gardens, wide-open beachfronts and the most surreal ocean views. The original village of Pasikuda with its guesthouses, hawker stalls and fishing boats infuse local flavor to the south of the bay. During the high season, jet skis, kayaks and sailing boats occupy the water.

				<h3>Mahathma Gandhi Park</h3>
Mahatma Gandhi Park is situated in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka. It is just a few kilometers away from the Batticaloa fort. It was built by Former President Mahinda Rajapakshe and declared open on March 22nd, 2013 in the Dayata Kirula Programme.
History of the park
There is no main reason for it to be named as the Mahatma Gandhi Park. Even though it has no direct relation to Mahatma Gandhi, it is dedicated to him for the efforts he made to bring peace to India along with Sri Lanka. There is a huge golden statue of Mahatma Gandhi established in this place. This place was a result of the effort taken to uplift recreational space for the people around the city.

				<h3>Sri Thirukoneswaram Kovil</h3>
Koneswaram temple of Trincomalee or Thirukonamalai Konesar Temple – The Temple of the Thousand Pillars and Dakshina-Then Kailasam is a classical-medieval Hindu temple complex in Trincomalee, a Hindu religious pilgrimage centre in Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. The most sacred of the Pancha Ishwarams of Sri Lanka, it was built significantly during the reign of the early Cholas and the Five Dravidians of the Early Pandyan Kingdom on top of Konesar Malai, a promontory overlooking Trincomalee District, Gokarna bay and the Indian Ocean. Its Pallava, Chola, Pandyan and Jaffna design reflect a continual Tamil Saivite influence in the Vannimai region from the classical period. The monument contains its main shrine to Shiva in the form Kona-Eiswara, shortened to Konesar. Connected at the mouth of the Mahavilli Ganga River to the footprint of Shiva at Sivan Oli Padam Malai at the river's source, the temple symbolically crowns the flow of the Ganges River from Shiva's head of Mount Kailash to his feet

				<h3>Fort Frederick</h3>
Fort Fredrick, also known as Trincomalee Fort is a fort built by the Portuguese at Trincomalee, Eastern Province, Sri Lanka, completed in 1624 CE, built on Swami Rock-Konamamalai from the debris of the world-famous ancient Hindu Koneswaram temple. The temple was destroyed by the Portuguese colonial Constantino de Sá de Noronha under Phillip III, occupier of the Jaffna kingdom and Malabar country on the island. On the Konamalai cape was also built a new village of Portuguese and Tamil people, 50 Portuguese soldiers and inside the fort, a church named after "Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe". The Fort of Triquillimale was dismantled and rebuilt by the Dutch in 1665, renamed Fort Fredrick

			<h3>Dutch Bay Beach</h3>
A splendid beach perfect to hang around, jogging or take a stroll in the evenings and enjoy the local street food. It is a clean golden sandy beach spreaded across a few kilometers. People do swim here, however it's good to avoid as sometimes the waters can get dangerous with strong undertows. Evenings are best to visit as the sun gets too hot during the day. You’d see the local fishing boats on the shores waiting to go in the waters
