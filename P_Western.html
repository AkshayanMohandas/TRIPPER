The monument was built at the location where the formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester occurred at a special podium February 4, 1948.

			<p><h3>Beira Lake</h3>
Beira Lake is a lake in the center of the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka. The lake is surrounded by many large businesses in the city. It initially occupied approximately 1.65 km² of land 100 years ago and this has since been reduced to 0.65 km² today due to various reasons. During the colonial era of the Portuguese, Dutch and the English the lake was used for a wide variety of purposes. It still retains its Portuguese name. It is connected to many intricate canals which provided an easy way of transporting goods within the city and suburban cities

				<h3>Kalutara Bodhiya</h3>
The Kalutara Chaitya is a Stupa located immediately south of the Kalutara Bridge in the Kalutara District of Sri Lanka. It is one of only a few hollow Buddhist stupas in the world and its interior contains 74 murals, each depicting a different aspect of the Buddha's life. Four small chaityas are located inside the larger hollow stupa and on the walls of the larger stupa, scenes from Jataka tales are painted. Visitors can walk inside the Kalutara Chaitya to worship and to look at the statues and wall paintings of the stories of Buddha. The stupa was commissioned by Sir Cyril de Zoysa, with the design undertaken by Justin Samarasekera in collaboration with A. N. S. Kulasinghe. The construction was carried out by the State Engineering Corporation of Sri Lanka, whose computer enabled the complicated calculations to be carried out. The large 30.5 m diameter and 91.5 m circumference concrete dome has a thin shell with a thickness of 140 mm. It was the first thin hemispherical shell built in the country. The site of the stupa was originally occupied by the Gangatilaka Vihara, however it was destroyed by the Portuguese when they invaded the country
